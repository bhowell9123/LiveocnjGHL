# GoHighLevel API Validation Status

## Summary

We've successfully implemented validation scripts for the v2 sync process between Supabase and GoHighLevel (GHL). The scripts verify that tenant data from Supabase correctly syncs to GHL contacts with the right phone numbers, rent fields, and opportunities.

### Scripts Created

1. `scripts/fetch100.ts` - Fetches contact data from GoHighLevel for 100 sample tenants
2. `scripts/compare100.ts` - Compares the tenant data with the GHL contact data
3. `scripts/validate-sync.sh` - Shell script to run both scripts in sequence

## Issues Encountered and Resolved

### 1. Authentication Issues

Initially, we encountered 403 Forbidden errors when trying to access the GHL API. After investigation, we discovered:

- The environment variable for the Private Integration Token (PIT) wasn't being properly accessed
- We resolved this by hardcoding the token and location ID in the fetch100.ts script

### 2. API Endpoint Structure

We confirmed the correct endpoint format is `/contacts?query=searchterm&locationId=locationId`. The API doesn't accept `email=` parameter directly, only `query=`.

## Current Validation Results

After fixing the authentication issues, we ran the validation script again and got the following results:

- **Missing contacts**: 2 out of 100
- **Phone mismatches**: 27
- **Missing rent fields**: 98
- **Missing opportunities**: 98

## Recommendations for Further Improvements

### 1. Missing Contacts (2)

- Implement phone-fallback lookup in the sync process
- Add PATCH-on-409 in upsertContactV2 function

### 2. Phone Mismatches (27)

- Dump payload before POST to verify the phone format
- Ensure cleanPhone() function returns phone numbers in the format `+1XXXXXXXXXX`
- Current issues include:
  - Missing country code
  - Extra digits
  - Multiple phone numbers not properly separated

### 3. Missing Rent Fields (98)

- Verify custom field IDs in Supabase secrets
- Log body.customFields to ensure the correct field IDs are being used
- Ensure the CF_TOTAL_LIFETIME_RENT environment variable is set correctly

### 4. Missing Opportunities (98)

- Test the v2 endpoint with current pipelineId & stageId using cURL
- Verify that the opportunity creation process is working correctly

## Next Steps

1. Fix the phone number formatting issues in the sync process
2. Implement the custom field mapping for rent fields
3. Fix the opportunity creation process
4. Run the validation script again to verify the fixes

## Artifacts

The following artifacts have been generated and can be used for further analysis:

- `ghl_contacts_100.json` - Raw contact data from GHL
- `tenant_supabase_examples.json` - Tenant data from Supabase
- `sync_validation_report.json` - Detailed report of the validation results
