# GoHighLevel Phone Number Sync Project Summary

## Current Challenge

We're working on fixing phone number formatting issues in GoHighLevel contacts, particularly focusing on a specific scenario where multiple phone numbers are being concatenated into a single string when syncing tenant data to GoHighLevel.

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Phone Number Concatenation**: When phone numbers like `8567805758 / 6097744077` are stored in Supabase, they were being concatenated into a single string like `+185678057586097` in GoHighLevel.

2. **Multiple Contact Records**: We have multiple contact records for the same person in GoHighLevel (e.g., Caty/Gail Berman), each representing different rental history. We want to maintain these separate records while ensuring proper phone number formatting.

3. **Duplicate Contact Restrictions**: GoHighLevel prevents updating a contact's phone number if it would create a duplicate of another contact, which complicates our fix for contacts with concatenated phone numbers.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Fixed the Root Cause**: Updated `index.ts` to properly handle multiple phone numbers separated by slashes:
   - Now splits phone numbers at the slash
   - Uses the first number as the primary phone
   - Stores additional numbers in a custom field
   - Formats phone numbers correctly with international format and spaces

2. **Created Custom Field**: Set up a "Secondary Phone" custom field in GoHighLevel to store additional phone numbers.

3. **Updated Environment Variables**: Set `CF_SECONDARY_PHONE` to the correct ID (`dUoWlbAVthPsHu52dhxi`).

4. **Deployed to Production**: The updated code has been deployed to production.

5. **Workaround for Existing Contacts**: For contacts with already concatenated phone numbers that can't be directly updated due to duplicate restrictions, we've added the secondary phone number as a custom field with a note about the phone number issue.

## Current Status

- The fix for new syncs is in place and working correctly.
- For existing contacts with concatenated phone numbers, we've implemented a workaround by adding the secondary phone number as a custom field.
- The system now correctly handles multiple phone numbers separated by slashes in new syncs.

## Important Note

**Multiple Contact Records**: It's important to understand that we have multiple contact records for the same person (e.g., Caty/Gail Berman) because they represent different rental history. We want to maintain these separate records while ensuring proper phone number formatting. The goal is not to merge these contacts but to ensure each has properly formatted phone numbers.

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring for any remaining phone number formatting issues.
2. Consider implementing a more comprehensive solution for handling duplicate contacts if needed.
3. Explore options for better syncing of rental history across multiple contact records for the same person.
